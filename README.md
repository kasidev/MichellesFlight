# MichellesFlight
A description of Michelle Obamas first flight

I remember the jet engines firing shockingly loud
and then when we were rattling down the runway
and beginning to tilt upwards,
as the acceleration ceased my chest
and pressed me backwards into my seat
for that strange 
in-between 
half moment 
that comes 
before finally 
you feel lifted

Obama, Michelle. Becoming. Crown, 2018
