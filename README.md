# MichellesFlight
A description of Michelle Obamas first flight

I remember the jet engines firing shockingly loud<br/>
and then when we were rattling down the runway<br/>
and beginning to tilt upwards,<br/>
as the acceleration ceased my chest<br/>
and pressed me backwards into my seat<br/>
for that strange<br/> 
in-between<br/> 
half moment<br/> 
that comes<br/> 
before finally<br/> 
you feel lifted<br/>

Obama, Michelle. Becoming. Crown, 2018
